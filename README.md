##Adding new Folders: 

When adding a folder, if github does not seem to be about to track the contents of the folder, do the following in the command line: 

 * navigate to the cloned repository folder
   * (do not navigate to inside of the new subFolder)
 * git add folderName/*
  
After that, you may sync (push to master) in the github gui, or in the command line. You might want to double check online that github has the contents of the new folder.
